Improve Detection at Far Distance
1.1 Face Detection (Reduce False Positives)
The occasional misidentification of non-faces as faces at 5+ meters is likely due to the Haar cascade classifier’s sensitivity to noise or patterns resembling faces (e.g., shadows, objects). Haar cascades are less robust than DNN-based models, especially at longer distances where faces are smaller.
Adjustments:
Increase minNeighbors: This requires more neighboring detections to confirm a face, reducing false positives.

Adjust scaleFactor: A smaller value (e.g., 1.05) detects smaller faces but may increase computation; test for balance.

Set minSize: Ensure detected faces are at least a reasonable size to filter out noise.

Optional DNN Model: Switch to a DNN-based face detector (e.g., OpenCV’s ResNet-10 SSD) for higher accuracy, though it’s slower.

1.2 Hand Detection (Enable at 5+ Meters)
Hand detection failing at 5 meters is expected because:
At 640x480 resolution, hands at 5 meters appear very small (e.g., 10-20 pixels), below MediaPipe’s detection threshold.

MediaPipe’s hand detection model is optimized for close-to-mid range (0.5-3 meters).

Adjustments:
Lower min_detection_confidence: Increase sensitivity to detect smaller or less clear hands.

Increase Resolution: Test 1280x720 to capture more detail, though this may reduce FPS.

Pre-process Frame: Apply sharpening or contrast enhancement to make distant hands more distinct.

Fallback: If MediaPipe fails, consider a custom hand detection model (e.g., YOLO-based, but requires training).

1.3 Motion Detection
Motion detection seems reliable at both near and far distances, but we’ll ensure it’s not overly sensitive to small movements (e.g., lighting changes).
Adjustments:
Tune motion_threshold: Increase to filter out small movements (e.g., from 5000 to 10000).

Adjust MOG2 Parameters: Increase varThreshold to reduce noise sensitivity.
